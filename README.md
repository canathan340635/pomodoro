Hello, this is my personal project pomodoro clock and right now ( 26 Dec 2021) it has the all the features for a basic clock application. However, I will be trying to improve this project gradually as I get better at JavaScript and web programming in general.

    - How many pomodoros the user has completed.
    - How many full cycles the user has completed total.
    - How many cycles  the user has completed today.
    - The current pomodoro #  incase the user closes the site or something similar.
    - Add ability to add tasks

- Add a navigation bar
- Improve the style in general
    - Different colors
